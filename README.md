# Hani's Digital Portfolio - An iOS 26 "Liquid Glass" Concept  

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio, a forward-thinking project designed to be more than just a website—it's an **immersive digital experience**.  

This portfolio reimagines the personal showcase as a **futuristic iOS concept**, featuring a sophisticated "liquid glass" UI that emphasizes **depth, light, and interactivity**.

## 💡 Core Concept: *Your Work, In Its Element*  

The guiding principle of this project was to create a canvas that doesn’t just *show* work, but **brings it to life**.  

Traditional portfolios often feel static. This one aims to feel like a **personal operating system**, where the visitor can interact with your journey and skills in a **fluid, intuitive way**.  

The design language is inspired by a **speculative iOS 26**, using translucent, layered materials (*Aura Glass*) to create a sense of space and focus.
